# SlewRateLimiter Library

The `SlewRateLimiter` is an all-integer Arduino compatible library that enables smooth signal transition control by limiting the rate of signal changes â€” the slew rate. By avoiding the use of floating-point operations, the library ensures fast execution suitable for real-time systems.

## Features

- **Fixed Slew Rate Limiting**: A constant maximum allowed change between consecutive output values.
- **Adaptive Slew Rate Limiting**: Dynamically adjusts the rate of change according to input deviations, enhancing responsiveness while preventing instability.
- **Hysteresis**: Implements a dead zone to suppress output fluctuations in response to minor input changes, thus reducing noise.
- **EMA Smoothing**: Utilizes an integer-based Exponential Moving Average algorithm to smooth out the reference signal.

## SRL_SmoothingExponent Enum

The `SRL_SmoothingExponent` enum offers predefined settings for the EMA smoothing operation, which determines the weight of recent input values on the moving average. The actual smoothing factor used in calculations is \( 2^{value} \), where `value` is the enum constant. The larger the exponent, the smoother the output but with a slower response to changes:

- `SRL_SMOOTHING_1`: Equivalent to a smoothing factor of \( 2^0 \), providing the fastest response with minimal smoothing.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_2`: Corresponds to \( 2^1 \), offering a balance between responsiveness and smoothing.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_4`: Uses \( 2^2 \), increasing the smoothness with a slightly delayed response.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_8`: Represents \( 2^3 \), further smoothing the signal.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_16`: Equivalent to \( 2^4 \), designed for more pronounced smoothing.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_32`: Matches \( 2^5 \), for a significant reduction in signal noise.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_64`: Reflects \( 2^6 \), heavily smoothing signal fluctuations.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_128`: Corresponds to \( 2^7 \), for very smooth signal transitions.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_256`: Equivalent to \( 2^8 \), creating a very delayed but smooth response.
- `SRL_SMOOTHING_512`: At \( 2^9 \), this provides the slowest response with the highest level of smoothing.

## Methods

- `processValue(int currentValue)`: Applies rate limiting to an input value and returns the processed output. Note that the input value here refers to the new value to be processed, not the EMA directly.
- `setRateLimit(int limit)`: Configures the maximum change permitted per update in fixed mode.
- `setHysteresisBand(int band)`: Establishes the range within which the output remains unchanged to filter out noise.
- `setSmoothingExponent(SRL_SmoothingExponent exponent)`: Adjusts the EMA smoothing factor to control the signal's smoothness and responsiveness.
- `setAdaptiveSlope(int slope)`: Determines the rate at which the slew rate increases with larger input deviations.
- `reset()`: Clears the internal state, including the EMA and last output.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Rate Limiting

```
#include <SlewRateLimiter.h>

// Initialize a limiter with default smoothing, a rate limit of 5 units, and a hysteresis band of 2 units
SlewRateLimiter myLimiter(SlewRateLimiter::SRL_SMOOTHING_4, 5, 2);

void setup() {
  // Setup code here
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read some sensor value
  int limitedValue = myLimiter.processValue(sensorValue); // Limit the rate of change
  // Use limitedValue as needed
}
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Slew Rate

```
#include "SlewRateLimiter.h"

// Initialize with a higher smoothing level, rate limit, hysteresis band, and an adaptive slope
// Adaptive slope has a base of 128.  so a value of 128 will give a slopw of 1
SlewRateLimiter myLimiter(SlewRateLimiter::SRL_SMOOTHING_16, 10, 3, 50);

void setup() {
  // Any required setup code here
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read the sensor value
  int limitedValue = myLimiter.processValue(sensorValue); // Apply adaptive slew rate limiting
  // Utilize limitedValue for further processing
}
```

## Performance

As the `SlewRateLimiter` uses integer math for all calculations, it's highly efficient and suitable for resource-constrained environments like microcontrollers. This makes the library ideal for high-performance or time-critical applications where every millisecond counts.
