# SlewRateLimiter Library

The `SlewRateLimiter` is an all-integer Arduino compatible library that enables smooth signal transition control by limiting the rate of signal changes â€” the slew rate. By avoiding the use of floating-point operations, the library ensures fast execution suitable for real-time systems.

## Features

- **Fixed Slew Rate Limiting**: A constant maximum allowed change between consecutive output values.
- **Adaptive Slew Rate Limiting**: Dynamically adjusts the rate of change according to input deviations, enhancing responsiveness while preventing instability.
- **Hysteresis**: Implements a dead zone to suppress output fluctuations in response to minor input changes, thus reducing noise.
- **EMA Smoothing**: Utilizes an integer-based Exponential Moving Average algorithm to smooth out the reference signal.

## SmoothingExponent Enum

The `SmoothingExponent` enum provides predefined settings for the smoothing operation, controlling the weight of the most recent input values on the moving average. Higher values result in smoother outputs but with a slower response to changes:

- `SMOOTHING_VALUE_1`: Fastest response, least smoothing.
- `SMOOTHING_VALUE_2`: ...
- `SMOOTHING_VALUE_4`: ...
- (Continue for each enum value)
- `SMOOTHING_VALUE_512`: Slowest response, most smoothing.

Each enum value effectively represents a power of 2. For instance, `SMOOTHING_VALUE_16` corresponds to using \( 2^{4} \) in the EMA calculation.

## Methods

Here are the main methods provided by the `SlewRateLimiter`:

- `processValue(int currentValue)`: Applies rate limiting to an input value and returns the processed output. Note that the input value here refers to the new value to be processed, not the EMA directly.
- `setRateLimit(int limit)`: Configures the maximum change permitted per update in fixed mode.
- `setHysteresisBand(int band)`: Establishes the range within which the output remains unchanged to filter out noise.
- `setSmoothingExponent(SmoothingExponent exponent)`: Sets the EMA smoothing factor.
- `setAdaptiveSlope(int slope)`: Determines the rate at which the slew rate increases with larger input deviations.
- `reset()`: Clears the internal state, including the EMA and last output.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Rate Limiting

```
#include "SlewRateLimiter.h"

// Initialize a limiter with default smoothing, a rate limit of 5 units, and a hysteresis band of 2 units
SlewRateLimiter myLimiter(SMOOTHING_VALUE_4, 5, 2);

void setup() {
  // Setup code here
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read some sensor value
  int limitedValue = myLimiter.processValue(sensorValue); // Limit the rate of change
  // Use limitedValue as needed
}
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Slew Rate

```
#include "SlewRateLimiter.h"

// Initialize with a higher smoothing level, rate limit, hysteresis band, and an adaptive slope
SlewRateLimiter myLimiter(SMOOTHING_VALUE_16, 10, 3, 50);

void setup() {
  // Any required setup code here
}

void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); // Read the sensor value
  int limitedValue = myLimiter.processValue(sensorValue); // Apply adaptive slew rate limiting
  // Utilize limitedValue for further processing
}
```

## Performance

As the `SlewRateLimiter` uses integer math for all calculations, it's highly efficient and suitable for resource-constrained environments like microcontrollers. This makes the library ideal for high-performance or time-critical applications where every millisecond counts.
